Leveraging CUDA DGX 

Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the range of outcomes for a series of parameters, each of which has a probability distribution showing how likely each option is to happen. In this project, you will take a scenario and develop a Monte Carlo simulation of it, determining how likely a particular output is to happen.
